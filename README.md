Task 3 – Linear Regression

# Task 3: Linear Regression – Simple & Multiple

This project implements **Simple and Multiple Linear Regression** using Python and Scikit-learn to predict house prices. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Understand and implement Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models.
- Learn how to evaluate regression models using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² Score.
- Visualize the regression line and interpret the model coefficients.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- Matplotlib 📈
- Scikit-learn 🤖

---

## 🗂 Dataset

The dataset used is a **House Price Prediction dataset** (`house_data.csv`) with the following sample columns:

Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Parking, Price

---

## ✅ Tasks Covered

### 🔹 Simple Linear Regression
- Feature: `Area`
- Target: `Price`
- Plotted the regression line
- Evaluated using MAE, MSE, R²

### 🔹 Multiple Linear Regression
- Features: `Area`, `Bedrooms`, `Bathrooms`, `Parking`
- Target: `Price`
- Evaluated the model and printed coefficients

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
- **MSE** (Mean Squared Error)
- **R² Score** (Goodness of Fit)

---

## 📌 Output Examples

- Visualization of predicted vs actual house prices (for Simple Regression)
- Printed model coefficients and performance scores

---

## 📁 How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `Task3_Linear_Regression.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
3. Upload your dataset (`house_data.csv`)
4. Run each cell in order

## 🧠 What I Learned

- The difference between simple and multiple regression
- How to evaluate regression models
- How each feature impacts the final prediction
